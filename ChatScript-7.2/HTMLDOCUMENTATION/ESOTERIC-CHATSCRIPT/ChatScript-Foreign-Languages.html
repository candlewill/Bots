<h1 id="foreign-language-overview">Foreign Language Overview</h1>
<p>ChatScript comes natively with full English support. If you want to use a different language you need a variety of things. * Pos-tagging support * Spell check support * Concepts in the language * LIVEDATA substitutions appropriate to the language * Patterns in the language * Output in the language</p>
<p>ChatScript has a command line parameter <code>language=</code> that tells CS the language you intend. It defaults to <code>ENGLISH</code>. The effects of this parameter are several. * If not ENGLISH, internal pos-tagging and parsing are disabled. * The system will use DICT/<code>language</code>. * The system will use LIVEDATA/<code>language</code> * The script compiler will automatically compile lines marked with the language (see language comments).</p>
<p>ChatScript supports two kinds of conditional compile comments. Single line comments look like this:</p>
<pre><code>#ENGLISH this line will compile if the language is English but not if the language is GERMAN.
#GERMAN this line will not compile if the language is English but will compile if the language is GERMAN.</code></pre>
<p>As always, such comments run til end of line. The other comment is the block comment like this:</p>
<pre><code>##&lt;&lt;ENGLISH these lines will be compiled under English 
until a normal closing block comment ##&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Using conditional compilation, you can make English and other language versions of code sit side by side if you want to.</p>
<p>ChatScript supports UTF8, so making output or patterns in the language is entirely up to you. Ditto for LIVEDATA.</p>
<p>The dictionary file can be just a list of words of the language, one per line. You must list all conjugations of a word because there is no in-built support to figure that out.</p>
<p>If you want the POS values and lemmas (canonical form of a word), you will need a POS-tagger of some sort. While it is possible to hook in an external tagger via a web call, that will be noticably slower than an in-built system. ChatScript supports in-build TreeTagger system, which supports a number of languages. However, you can only use this if you have a commercial license. You can try it out using ^popen, as is done in the German bot, however it will be slow because it has to reinitialize TreeTagger for every sentence. The in-built system does not. A license (per language) is about $1000 and you can contact me if you want to arrange to use it.</p>
